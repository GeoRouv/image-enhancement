# image-enhancement
Multiple processing techniques to analyze and enhance images

# Tasks
1.
    * a) Explain the impact of the following transformation function on a grayscale image, in terms of intensity values and brightness.  
    <br><div><img src="step_fun.png" width="500"></div>  <br>
    * b) Verify by applying the transformation on an image of choice (including input/output images)  
2. Propose a method for enhancing the image “nature_dark_forest.jpg” in terms of the perceived light and color  
<br><div><img src="nature_dark_forest.jpg" width="500"></div>  <br>
3. Propose a method for improving the image “pollen-500x430px-96dpi.jpg” in terms the perceived brightness  
<br><div><img src="pollen-500x430px-96dpi.jpg" width="500"></div>  <br>
4.
    * a) Try to guess the processing steps adopted. (Note the dynamic range and brightness of the enhanced image, and the noise introduced.)  
    <br><div><img src="image_2.jpg" width="500"></div><br>
    * b) Propose a pipeline of processes with the aim of approximating “image_1” starting from “image_2”  
    <br><div><img src="image_1.jpg" width="500"></div><br>
    <br><div><img src="image_2.jpg" width="500"></div><br>
